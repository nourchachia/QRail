QRail Neural Rail Conductor - FastAPI Backend
================================================================================

🎯 WHAT IS THIS FILE?
----------------------
This is the REST API layer that connects your frontend to the AI backend.

📊 WHY ALL IN ONE FILE?
-----------------------
For a hackathon/demo project, having everything in main.py is INTENTIONAL:
✅ Easier to read and understand the complete flow
✅ Simpler deployment (one file to deploy)
✅ Faster development (no hunting through multiple files)

For production, you'd split into:
- routes.py (endpoint definitions)
- schemas.py (Pydantic models)
- middleware.py (CORS, auth, logging)

But for QRail demo, this unified approach is cleaner.

🔗 MODELS 4 & 5 INTEGRATION
----------------------------
Q: "Does this code include Model 4/5?"
A: YES! It calls them via integration.py

HOW IT WORKS NOW (before Models 4/5 ready):
- integration.py tries to load Models 4/5
- If not found, returns empty defaults
- API still works, just with partial results

WHEN MODELS 4/5 READY:
- Integration.py automatically uses them
- API code needs ZERO changes (maybe 2 lines for cleaner syntax)
- Everything just works

🚀 HOW TO RUN THIS
------------------
STEP 1: Open terminal
STEP 2: cd C:\Users\ASUS\Desktop\projects2025\QRail
STEP 3: python src/api/main.py
STEP 4: Open http://localhost:8001/docs

⚠️ IMPORTANT: The server must be RUNNING before you visit the link!

from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Dict, Optional
import os
from pathlib import Path

# =====================================================================
# === STEP 1: Setup Project Root Path ===
# =====================================================================
# WHY: Need to import from src/ directory
# WHAT: Add project root to Python path
# HOW: Calculate root and append to sys.path
# BEFORE: Python can't find src.backend modules
# AFTER: Can import integration.py and other modules

project_root = str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent)
import sys
if project_root not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append(project_root)

# =====================================================================
# === STEP 2: Import AI Pipeline ===
# =====================================================================
# WHY: This is the "brain" that processes incidents
# WHAT: Import IncidentPipeline from integration.py
# HOW: IncidentPipeline already handles Models 1-5
# BEFORE: No AI processing capability
# AFTER: Can analyze incidents end-to-end
#
# 📌 NOTE ON MODELS 4/5:
# - IncidentPipeline tries to load all 5 models
# - If Model 4/5 not found: returns empty conflicts/recommendations
# - If Model 4/5 ready: returns AI predictions
# - This API doesn't care which case - it works either way!

from src.backend.integration import IncidentPipeline

# =====================================================================
# === STEP 3: Create FastAPI Application ===
# =====================================================================
# WHY: FastAPI provides REST API framework
# WHAT: Initialize app with metadata
# HOW: Auto-generates docs at /docs
# BEFORE: No API server
# AFTER: RESTful API ready to receive requests

app = FastAPI(
    title="QRail Neural Rail Conductor API",
    description="AI-powered railway incident management system",
    version="1.0.0"

# =====================================================================
# === STEP 4: Add CORS Middleware ===
# =====================================================================
# WHY: Frontend (React) runs on different port, need CORS
# WHAT: Allow requests from localhost:3000 and localhost:5173
# HOW: FastAPI CORSMiddleware handles this automatically
# BEFORE: Browser blocks API calls due to CORS policy
# AFTER: Frontend can call API without errors
#
# 📌 PORTS EXPLAINED:
# - 3000: Default Create React App port
# - 5173: Default Vite (modern React) port
# - 8000: This API server port

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:5173", "*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

# =====================================================================
# === STEP 5: Initialize AI Pipeline (HAPPENS ONCE ON STARTUP) ===
# =====================================================================
# WHY: Loading models is slow - do it once, not per request
# WHAT: Create IncidentPipeline instance
# HOW: Loads all models, connects to Qdrant
# BEFORE: Server starts but models not loaded
# AFTER: All AI components ready to use
#
# 📌 WHAT LOADS HERE:
# - Model 1 (GNN): ✅ Always loaded
# - Model 2 (LSTM): ✅ Always loaded
# - Model 3 (Semantic): ✅ Always loaded
# - Model 4 (Conflict): ⚠️ Loaded if file exists, else None
# - Model 5 (Outcome): ⚠️ Loaded if file exists, else None
# - Qdrant client: ✅ Connects to cloud

# =====================================================================
# === REQUEST/RESPONSE MODELS (Type Safety with Pydantic) ===
# =====================================================================
# WHY: Type validation and auto-generated docs

📘 USAGE GUIDE
================================================================================

STEP BEFORE RUNNING THIS:
--------------------------
1. Make sure uploader.py has populated Qdrant (800 incidents)
2. Make sure integration.py works (test it standalone)
3. Install FastAPI: pip install fastapi uvicorn

HOW TO RUN:
-----------
cd C:\Users\ASUS\Desktop\projects2025\QRail
python src/api/main.py

OR with uvicorn directly:
uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload --port 8000

STEP AFTER RUNNING THIS:
-------------------------
1. Open http://localhost:8000/docs to see interactive API docs
2. Test the /api/analyze endpoint with sample text
3. Build frontend that calls these endpoints

TESTING THE API:
----------------
# Using curl:
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/analyze" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text": "Signal failure at Central Station"}'

# Using Python:
import requests
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/api/analyze",
    json={"text": "Signal failure at Central Station"}
)
print(response.json())

FRONTEND INTEGRATION:
---------------------
// React/Next.js example:
const analyzeIncident = async (text) => {
  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/api/analyze', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ text })
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
};

CHANGES WHEN MODELS 4 & 5 READY:
---------------------------------
MINIMAL! Just these lines in analyze_incident():

BEFORE (now):
    "conflicts": result.get('conflicts', {}),
    "recommendations": result.get('recommendations', [])

AFTER (when ready):
    "conflicts": result['conflicts'],  # Direct access
    "recommendations": result['recommendations']

That's it! The endpoint structure stays exactly the same.
